1. **Physical Build**: The gorilla is portrayed with a highly muscular and robust physique, emphasizing its strength and power. The chest and arms are particularly well-defined, showcasing pronounced muscles.

2. **Facial Expression**: The gorilla has a stern and somewhat aggressive facial expression. Its eyebrows are furrowed, and its mouth is slightly open, giving it a menacing look.

3. **Posture**: The gorilla is standing in a slightly crouched, ready stance with its arms slightly bent and its fists clenched, further emphasizing its readiness for action.

4. **Coloration**: The gorilla's fur is primarily dark, with lighter shading on its chest and face, adding depth and dimension to the illustration.

5. **Art Style**: The artwork is done in a cartoonish or comic book style, with clean lines and vibrant colors. The shading and highlights are used effectively to give the gorilla a three-dimensional appearance.
